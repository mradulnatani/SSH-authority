## SSH Certificate Authority
This SSH Certificate Authority project provides a secure and scalable solution for managing SSH access across distributed infrastructure. Traditional methods like passwords and static public keys are either insecure or difficult to manage at scale. This system replaces them with short-lived, signed SSH certificates that are issued dynamically based on user identity and role. By integrating JWT based authentication, and tools like Consul, Confd, and OpenSSH CA, it automates the entire certificate lifecycleâ€”ensuring time-bound access, easy revocation, and complete auditability.
